This question assesses your understanding of tidy data principles.

Clean up the file that was originally named `Survey Data.xlsx`. Some points to remember: aim for a single tidy data frame in a single tab, don't use formatting as data, use preferred date format, properly record null values.

Export this as a tab-delimited `.csv` text file with Unix line endings.

Commit the modified `.xlsx` file and the `.csv` file and publish to your public GitHub repository.

_Include the link to your `.csv` file on GitHub here._
