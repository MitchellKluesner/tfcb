    "For the homework, you are going to extend the code from the analysis of our FASTQ file in lectures 8 and 9.\n",
    "Recall that the FASTQ file contains reads from a real sequencing run of influenza virus HA and NA genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _actual sequences_ are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    5'-[end of HA]-AGGCGGCCGC-[16 X N barcode]-3'\n",
    "    \n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "    5'-[end of NA]-AGGCGGCCGC-[16 X N barcode]-3'\n",
    "    \n",
    "The end of NA is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...CACGATAGATAAATAATAGTGCACCAT\n",
    "    \n",
    "The end of HA is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...CCGGATTTGCATATAATGATGCACCAT\n",
    "    \n",
    "The _sequencing reads_ (located in the FASTQ file) are from the reverse end of these actual sequences, so the first thing in the sequencing reads is the reverse complement of the barcode followed by the reverse complement of the constant sequence, etc.\n",
    "The reads can originate from **either** HA or NA, and that will be distinguished by the most 3' end of the read.\n",
    "But in our example exercise in class, we did not distinguish among reads matching to HA and NA, as we didn't even look far enough into the read to tell the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the homework, your goal is to write code that extends the material from lectures 8 and 9 to also distinguish between HA and NA.\n",
    "This homework can be completed almost entirely by re-using code from lecture 9. You will need to set up your analysis to do the following:\n",
    " 1. Get the reverse complement of each read.\n",
    " 2. Determine if it matches the expected pattern for HA and NA, and if so which one.\n",
    " 3. If it matches, extract the barcode and add it to a dictionary to keep track of counts.\n",
    " 4. Determine the number and distribution of barcodes for HA and NA separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please include code to address each of the following questions. Please include code comments to explain what your code is attempting to accomplish. Don't forget to include references to the sources you used to obtain your answer, including your classmates (if you are working in groups).  "
